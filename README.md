# PDF CV Builder

A programme to take Data collected from the users input and transformed it into a PDF using PHP, including a photo and clickable links. This gives the user an option to quickly generate a CV, even while on the go and have it emailed to them or another address.

Futher development would see options saved locally, and perhaps online in a DB with login access to make it easier to change details. I would also like to offer more Designs for users to pick from.

## Done so far:
* HTML form
* JS UI to add input fields for sections
* AJAX Request to POST to PHP
* Photograph saved to folder from input
* PHP rough build of pdf CV from data
* Generated PDF saved

## Still to do:
* CSS - to make the form more presentable, Responsive & user friendly
* JavaScript checks on Imputs to alert user to any incorrect values given
* PHP checks of Data & File before making the PDF
* Check longer inputs and contraints
* Make Pdf Prettier

## Further Development
* Add more designs the user can choose from
* Saves locally
* Saves to DB with login
